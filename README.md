data science project
✅ task1/ – Sales Data Distribution Visualization
Objective: Visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using plots.

What I did:

Loaded a retail sales dataset using pandas

Analyzed basic structure: .head(), .shape, .info(), .describe()

Visualized:

Customer Age (histogram)

Customer Gender (count plot)

Checked for missing values and data quality

What I learned:

Basic EDA and data inspection

How to use matplotlib and seaborn to create clear, simple visualizations

Importance of exploring data distributions early in analysis



✅ task2/ – Electric Vehicle Population EDA + Z-Test
Objective: Perform full-scale EDA and statistical testing on EV dataset.

What I did:

Cleaned missing values (used mode() and median())

Visualized:

Top states, cities, makes, models

Electric range categories, types of EVs (BEV vs PHEV)

Year-wise trends and CAFV eligibility

Performed a Z-test comparing average model years of Tesla vs Nissan

Detected and fixed outliers using the IQR method

What I learned:

Practical data wrangling

How to perform statistical comparisons (Z-test)

Outlier handling and range binning

Insights storytelling through visual patterns




✅ task3/ – Bank Deposit Prediction using Decision Tree
Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will buy a term deposit.

What I did:

Used a preprocessed bank marketing dataset

Visualized distributions of age, balance, and duration

Explored target class imbalance

Built a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn

Evaluated model with accuracy score and confusion matrix

Plotted the tree using plot_tree for interpretation

What I learned:

ML model building and evaluation pipeline

Model explainability using decision tree visualization

How EDA improves feature understanding before modeling



✅ task4/ – US Accidents Data Analysis & Heatmap
Objective: Identify accident trends and map them geographically.

What I did:

Analyzed accident data based on:

City, hour, day of week, month, year

Weather conditions, temperature, and source

Created:

Heatmap using folium

Scatter plots of accident coordinates

Temperature distributions

Explored accident frequency under different weather and temperature conditions

What I learned:

Time-series and geospatial data analysis

Heatmap creation with Folium + HeatMap plugin

Feature engineering with temperature and datetime

How to communicate location-based insights visually
